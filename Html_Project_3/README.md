# 1. First Learning : -
# for taking icons go on font awesome cdn(bootsrapcdn) stackpath, and copy the link of that and paste here in the head inside link tag href.
 
 # <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css"> 

# after linking we have to go on font-awesome icons to bring icon code and paste in span before title.

 # and then use it before name or title using inline elemnt like span.
 #  <span class="fa fa-user-circle" aria-hidden="true">
     </span>

# 3. table inside table and each section is 80% same just make one section and copy then paste and do some changes in copied one and its actually become whole website gradually.
